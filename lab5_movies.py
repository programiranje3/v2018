# Create the Movie class with the following attributes: title, year, director, reviews.
# The first three attributes are self-explanatory, whereas the reviews represents a list
# of MovieReview objects (another class to be created in this task, see below).
# Implement the following methods of the Movie class:
# - constructor (__init__())
# - method that returns a string representation of the given Movie object (__str__())
# - method for checking for equality of the given Movie object and another object
#   that is passed to the method as its input parameter (__eq__())
# - methods for turning the given Movie object into an iterator (__iter__(), __next__())
#
# Create the MovieReview class with two private attributes: rating and comment.
# Valid values for these two attributes are as follows:
# - for rating: values between 1 and 5, including 1 and 5
# - for comment: any string value
# Use appropriate decorators to create get and set methods for these attributes.
# In addition, implement the method that returns a string representation of a
# MovieReview object (__str__()).
