# This task is based on the example from the "Practical Introduction to
# Web Scraping in Python" tutorial, available at:
# https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/

# The task is to write a Python program (script) that among the
# hundred greatest mathematicians of the past
# (http://www.fabpedigree.com/james/greatmm.htm)
# finds and prints 10 currently most popular mathematicians based
# on the level of attention they are receiving by the Web users.
# The popularity is approximated by the number of page views that
# the mathematicians' Wikipedia pages have received in the last 60 days;
# these (and many other) stats about Wikipedia pages can be obtained
# from the Wikipediaâ€™s XTools (https://xtools.wmflabs.org/).

# Some useful links:
# - requests developer interface (aka API)
# http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/
# - tutorial + documentation for BeautifulSoup:
# https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc
